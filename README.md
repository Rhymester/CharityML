CharityML

A machine learning model to make prediction of the chances of a person to be potential donar based on his/her current annual income and different feature set!

Model is trained and benchmarked on three algorithms :

  1.) Decision Tree classifier 
  2.) Support Vector Machine 
  3.) AdaBoost Classifier 

Libraries included in the project are:
  1.) Numpy
  2.) Pandas
  3.) Matplotlib
  4.) seaborn
  5.) scikit-learn
  
Final accuracy of all the models were evaluated and adaboost classifier was taken as the final training model and was further pruned!
